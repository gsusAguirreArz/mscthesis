The main goals include the search for antimatter, dark matter signals and exotic particles, the study of the mechanisms of production, acceleration and transport of cosmic rays, the monitoring of the solar modulation and its effects on the electrical charge-sign of particles and nuclei. These experiments are providing very precise measurements of antiproton, positron and electron fluxes and a direct measurement of the chemical composition and energy spectra of cosmic-ray nuclei from proton to Iron.

abstract = {Accurate and fast simulation of particle physics processes is crucial for the
high-energy physics community. Simulating particle interactions with detectors
is both time consuming and computationally expensive. With the proton-proton
collision energy of 13 TeV, the Large Hadron Collider is uniquely positioned to
detect and measure the rare phenomena that can shape our knowledge of new
interactions. The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) upgrade will
put a significant strain on the computing infrastructure due to increased event
rate and levels of pile-up. Simulation of high-energy physics collisions needs
to be significantly faster without sacrificing the physics accuracy. Machine
learning approaches can offer faster solutions, while maintaining a high level
of fidelity. We discuss a graph generative model that provides effective
reconstruction of LHC events, paving the way for full detector level fast
simulation for HL-LHC.},

abstract = {Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) rely on detailed simulations of particle collisions to build expectations of what experimental data may look like under different theory modeling assumptions. Petabytes of simulated data are needed to develop analysis techniques, though they are expensive to generate using existing algorithms and computing resources. The modeling of detectors and the precise description of particle cascades as they interact with the material in the calorimeter are the most computationally demanding steps in the simulation pipeline. We therefore introduce a deep neural network-based generative model to enable high-fidelity, fast, electromagnetic calorimeter simulation. There are still challenges for achieving precision across the entire phase space, but our current solution can reproduce a variety of particle shower properties while achieving speed-up factors of up to 100,000$\times$. This opens the door to a new era of fast simulation that could save significant computing time and disk space, while extending the reach of physics searches and precision measurements at the LHC and beyond.},

that our training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the Wake-Sleep

digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images,
and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also
discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of
eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that
InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with

contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a
divergence between real and generated distributions. We analyze the convergence
of GAN training from this new point of view to understand why mode collapse
happens. We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this
non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these
local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function
around some real data points. We demonstrate that these degenerate local
equilibria can be avoided with a gradient penalty scheme called DRAGAN. We show
that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer
mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling

calorimeter output as three-dimensional images. We prove the efficacy of
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating scientific data while
retaining a high level of accuracy for diverse metrics across a large range of
input variables. We demonstrate a successful application of the transfer
learning concept: we train the network to simulate showers for electrons from a
reduced range of primary energies, we then train further for a five times
larger range (the model could not train for the larger range directly). The
same concept is extended to generate showers for other particles (photons and
neutral pions) depositing most of their energies in electromagnetic
interactions. In addition, the generation of charged pion showers is also
explored, a more accurate effort would require additional data from other
detectors not included in the scope of the current work. Our further
contribution is a demonstration of using GAN-generated data for a practical
application. We train a third-party network using GAN-generated data and prove
that the response is similar to a network trained with data from the Monte
Carlo simulation. The showers generated by GAN present accuracy within $10\%$
of Monte Carlo for a diverse range of physics features, with three orders of
magnitude speedup. The speedup for both the training and inference can be
further enhanced by distributed training.},

The SHiP experiment will be able to search for new long-lived particles produced in a 400 GeV/c SPS proton beam dump and which travel distances between fifty metres and tens of kilometers. The SHiP detector needs to operate under ultra-low background conditions and requires large simulated samples of muon induced background processes. Through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks it is possible to emulate the simulation of the interaction of 400 GeV/c proton beams with the SHiP target, an otherwise computationally intensive process. For the simulation requirements of the SHiP experiment, generative networks are capable of approximating the full simulation of the dense fixed target, offering a speed increase by a factor of (106). To evaluate the performance of such an approach, comparisons of the distributions of reconstructed muon momenta in SHiP's spectrometer between samples using the full simulation and samples produced through generative models are presented.

the signals recorded by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Surface Detector
Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We apply deep learning architectures to
large sets of simulated data. The inner structure of the neural network is
optimized through the use of genetic algorithms. To obtain a prediction of the
recorded muon signal in each individual detector, we train neural networks with
a mixed sample of light, intermediate and heavy nuclei. When true and predicted
signals are compared at detector level, the primary values of the Pearson
correlation coefficients are above 95\%. The relative errors of the predicted
muon signals are below 10\% and do not depend on the event energy, zenith
angle, total signal size, distance range or the hadronic model used to generate
the events.},

abstract = {High energy cosmic rays and gamma rays interacting the atmosphere produce extensive air showers (EAS) of secondary particles emitting Cherenkov light. Being detected with a telescope this light forms "images" of the air shower. In the TAIGA project, in addition to images obtained experimentally, model data are widely used. The difficulty is that the computational models of the underlying physical processes are very resource intensive, since they track the type, energy, position and direction of all secondary particles born in EAS. For some data analysis purposes, this information is redundant, so that less complex and more efficient generation methods can be used. We applied a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to quickly generate images of two types: from gamma and protons events. As a training set, we used a sample of 2D images obtained using TAIGA Monte Carlo simulation software, containing about 50,000 events. It has been experimentally established that the generation results best fit the training set in the case when for two different types of events we create two different networks and train them separately. For gamma events a discriminator with a minimum number of convolutional layers was required, while for proton events, more stable and high-quality results are obtained if two additional fully connected layers are added to the discriminator. Testing the generators of both networks using third-party software showed that more than 90% of the generated images were found to be correct. Thus, the use of GAN provides reasonably fast and accurate simulations for the TAIGA project.},

in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative
model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector
Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways:
the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the
prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent
representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the
VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" --
where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful
autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing
these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high
quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker
conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of
the utility of the learnt representations.},

From the many questions still open in this area, knowledge of the type of primary for each event remains as one of the most important issues. All of the cosmic rays observatories have been trying to solve this question for at least six decades, but have not yet succeeded. The main obstacle is the impossibility of directly detecting high energy primary events, being necessary to use Monte Carlo models and simulations to characterize generated particles cascades. This work presents the results attained using a simulated dataset that was provided by the Monte Carlo code CORSIKA, which is a simulator of high energy particles interactions with the atmosphere, resulting in a cascade of secondary particles extending for a few kilometers (in diameter) at ground level. Using this simulated data, a set of machine learning classifiers have been designed and trained, and their computational cost and effectiveness compared, when classifying the type of primary under ideal measuring conditions. Additionally, a feature selection algorithm has allowed for identifying the relevance of the considered features. The results confirm the importance of the electromagnetic-muonic component separation from signal data measured for the problem. The obtained results are quite encouraging and open new work lines for future more restrictive simulations.},

abstract = {We describe a method of reconstructing air showers induced by cosmic rays using deep learning techniques. We simulate an observatory consisting of ground-based particle detectors with fixed locations on a regular grid. The detector's responses to traversing shower particles are signal amplitudes as a function of time, which provide information on transverse and longitudinal shower properties. In order to take advantage of convolutional network techniques specialized in local pattern recognition, we convert all information to the image-like grid of the detectors. In this way, multiple features, such as arrival times of the first particles and optimized characterizations of time traces, are processed by the network. The reconstruction quality of the cosmic ray arrival direction turns out to be competitive with an analytic reconstruction algorithm. The reconstructed shower direction, energy and shower depth show the expected improvement in resolution for higher cosmic ray energy.},

@article{Salamani2018,
abstract = {Detectors of High Energy Physics experiments, such as the ATLAS dectector [1] at the Large Hadron Collider [2], serve as cameras that take pictures of the particles produced in the collision events. One of the key detector technologies used for measuring the energy of particles are calorimeters. Particles will lose their energy in a cascade (called a shower) of electromagnetic and hadronic interactions with a dense absorbing material. The number of the particles produced in this showering process is subsequently measured across the sampling layers of the calorimeter. The deposition of energy in the calorimeter due to a developing shower is a stochastic process that can not be described from first principles and rather relies on a precise simulation of the detector response. It requires the modeling of particles interactions with matter at the microscopic level as implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [3]. This simulation process is inherently slow and thus presents a bottleneck in the ATLAS simulation pipeline [4]. The current work addresses this limitation. To meet the growing analysis demands, ATLAS already relies strongly on fast calorimeter simulation techniques based on thousands of individual parametrizations of the calorimeter response [5]. The algorithms currently employed for physics analyses by the ATLAS collaboration achieve a significant speedup over the full simulation of the detector response at the cost of accuracy. Current developments [6] [7] aim at improving the modeling of taus, jet-substructure-based boosted objects or wrongly identified objects in the calorimeter and will benefit from an improved detector description following data taking and a more detailed forward calorimeter geometry. Deep Learning techniques have been improving state of the art results in various science areas such as: astrophysics [8], cosmology [9] and medical imaging [10]. These techniques are able to describe complex data structures and scale well with highdimensionality problems. Generative models are powerful deep learning algorithms to map complex distributions into a lower dimensional space, to generate samples of higher dimensionality and to approximate the underlying probability densities. Among the most promising approaches are Variational Auto-Encoders [11] [12] and Generative Adversarial Networks [13]. In this context, the talk presents the first application of such models to the fast simulation of the calorimeter response in the ATLAS detector. This work [14] demonstrates the feasibility of using such algorithms for large scale high energy physics experiments in the future, and opens the possibility to complement current techniques.},

many unsupervised learning tasks and unarguably, clustering is an important
unsupervised learning problem. While one can potentially exploit the
latent-space back-projection in GANs to cluster, we demonstrate that the
cluster structure is not retained in the GAN latent space. In this paper, we propose ClusterGAN as a new mechanism for clustering using
GANs. By sampling latent variables from a mixture of one-hot encoded variables
and continuous latent variables, coupled with an inverse network (which
projects the data to the latent space) trained jointly with a clustering
specific loss, we are able to achieve clustering in the latent space. Our
results show a remarkable phenomenon that GANs can preserve latent space
interpolation across categories, even though the discriminator is never exposed
to such vectors. We compare our results with various clustering baselines and
demonstrate superior performance on both synthetic and real datasets.},

interactions is one of the oldest and most ambitious of human scientific
endeavors. Facilities such as CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) represent a
huge step forward in this quest. The discovery of the Higgs boson, the
observation of exceedingly rare decays of B mesons, and stringent constraints
on many viable theories of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) demonstrate
the great scientific value of the LHC physics program. The next phase of this
global scientific project will be the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which will
collect data starting circa 2026 and continue into the 2030's. The primary
science goal is to search for physics beyond the SM and, should it be
discovered, to study its details and implications. During the HL-LHC era, the
ATLAS and CMS experiments will record circa 10 times as much data from 100
times as many collisions as in LHC Run 1. The NSF and the DOE are planning
large investments in detector upgrades so the HL-LHC can operate in this
high-rate environment. A commensurate investment in R&D for the software for
acquiring, managing, processing and analyzing HL-LHC data will be critical to
maximize the return-on-investment in the upgraded accelerator and detectors.

@article{Burgess2018,
abstract = {We present new intuitions and theoretical assessments of the emergence of
disentangled representation in variational autoencoders. Taking a
rate-distortion theory perspective, we show the circumstances under which
representations aligned with the underlying generative factors of variation of
data emerge when optimising the modified ELBO bound in $\beta$-VAE, as training
progresses. From these insights, we propose a modification to the training
regime of $\beta$-VAE, that progressively increases the information capacity of
the latent code during training. This modification facilitates the robust
learning of disentangled representations in $\beta$-VAE, without the previous
trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.},
