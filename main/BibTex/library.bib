abstract = {Over the past five years, modern machine learning has been quietly revolutionizing particle physics. Old methodology is being outdated and entirely new ways of thinking about data are becoming commonplace. This article will review some aspects of the natural synergy between modern machine learning and particle physics, focusing on applications at the Large Hadron Collider. A sampling of examples is given, from signal/background discrimination tasks using supervised learning to direct data-driven approaches. Some comments on persistent challenges and possible future directions for the field are included at the end.},

@article{Erdmann2019,
abstract = {Simulations of particle showers in calorimeters are computationally time-consuming, as they have to reproduce both energy depositions and their considerable fluctuations. A new approach to ultra-fast simulations is generative models where all calorimeter energy depositions are generated simultaneously. We use GEANT4 simulations of an electron beam impinging on a multi-layer electromagnetic calorimeter for adversarial training of a generator network and a critic network guided by the Wasserstein distance. The generator is constrained during the training such that the generated showers show the expected dependency on the initial energy and the impact position. It produces realistic calorimeter energy depositions, fluctuations and correlations which we demonstrate in distributions of typical calorimeter observables. In most aspects, we observe that generated calorimeter showers reach the level of showers as simulated with the GEANT4 program.},

@article{Guillen2018,
abstract = {Deep neural networks are a powerful technique that have found ample
applications in several branches of Physics. In this work, we apply machine
learning algorithms to a specific problem of Cosmic Ray Physics: the estimation
of the muon content of extensive air showers when measured at the ground. As a
working case, we explore the performance of a deep neural network applied to
the signals recorded by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Surface Detector
Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We apply deep learning architectures to
large sets of simulated data. The inner structure of the neural network is
optimized through the use of genetic algorithms. To obtain a prediction of the
recorded muon signal in each individual detector, we train neural networks with
a mixed sample of light, intermediate and heavy nuclei. When true and predicted
signals are compared at detector level, the primary values of the Pearson
correlation coefficients are above 95$\backslash${\%}. The relative errors of the predicted
muon signals are below 10$\backslash${\%} and do not depend on the event energy, zenith
angle, total signal size, distance range or the hadronic model used to generate
the events.},

abstract = {Machine learning has played an important role in the analysis of high-energy physics data for decades. The emergence of deep learning in 2012 allowed for machine learning tools which could adeptly handle higher-dimensional and more complex problems than previously feasible. This review is aimed at the reader who is familiar with high-energy physics but not machine learning. The connections between machine learning and high-energy physics data analysis are explored, followed by an introduction to the core concepts of neural networks, examples of the key results demonstrating the power of deep learning for analysis of LHC data, and discussion of future prospects and concerns.},

abstract = {Machine learning has been applied to several problems in particle physics research, beginning with applications to high-level physics analysis in the 1990s and 2000s, followed by an explosion of applications in particle and event identification and reconstruction in the 2010s. In this document we discuss promising future research and development areas for machine learning in particle physics. We detail a roadmap for their implementation, software and hardware resource requirements, collaborative initiatives with the data science community, academia and industry, and training the particle physics community in data science. The main objective of the document is to connect and motivate these areas of research and development with the physics drivers of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and future neutrino experiments and identify the resource needs for their implementation. Additionally we identify areas where collaboration with external communities will be of great benefit.},

abstract = {Machine learning encompasses a broad range of algorithms and modeling tools used for a vast array of data processing tasks, which has entered most scientific disciplines in recent years. We review in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in machine learning (ML) motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross-fertilization between the two fields. After giving basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, we describe examples of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. We then move 2 to describe applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. We also highlight research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML. In each of the sections we describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.},

@inproceedings{Glombitza2019,
abstract = {The surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory measures the footprint of air showers induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The reconstruction of event-by-event information sensitive to the cosmic-ray mass, is a challenging task and so far mainly based on fluorescence detector observations with their duty cycle of ˜ 15{\%}. Recently, great progress has been made in multiple fields of machine learning using deep neural networks and associated techniques. Applying these new techniques to air-shower physics opens up possibilities for improved reconstruction, including an estimation of the cosmic-ray composition. In this contribution, we show that deep convolutional neural networks can be used for air-shower reconstruction, using surface-detector data. The focus of the machine-learning algorithm is to reconstruct depths of shower maximum. In contrast to traditional reconstruction methods, the algorithm learns to extract the essential information from the signal and arrival-time distributions of the secondary particles. We present the neural-network architecture, describe the training, and assess the performance using simulated air showers.},
